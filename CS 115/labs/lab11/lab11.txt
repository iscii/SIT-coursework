1. How low could you start the stack?
    - you can start as low as you'd like as long as the stack memory does not override any used registers. With our convention, this would be 16.
2. How deep does the stack get?
    - in the case of the slide's example with the fibonacci sequence, it goes 6 registers deep.
3. What are the possible values of r14?
    - 03 and 12

Notes:
basically, calln drops a flag/checkpoint on the next line and 
jumps to the specified line to execute stuff. jumpr jumps the code back to
the checkpoint.
